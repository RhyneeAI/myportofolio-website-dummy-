            <h2>About <span>Me</span></h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Hello everyone, my name is <strong>Luhung Lugina</strong>. <br><br>
                I’m an Indonesian national currently working as a Fullstack Developer at a software house called Madtive Studio, where I also serve as a mentor for students undergoing internships. <br><br>
                My journey into programming didn’t start with a clear plan. In fact, it all began when I wasn’t accepted into a scholarship program for a boarding school in Bogor. At the time, I was disappointed—but looking back, I realize that rejection was a turning point that unknowingly led me to where I am today. 
                I got into this field when two of my friends suggested I enroll in a vocational high school (SMK), majoring in Software Engineering (Rekayasa Perangkat Lunak - RPL). Back then, I had no idea what the program entailed. I simply thought, “Well, maybe we’ll just disassemble computers and tinker with software.” <br><br>
                Of course, it wasn’t that simple—not at all, LOL.... haha. <br><br>
                In my first semester, I was completely lost. I was introduced to a whole new world: programming languages, syntax, logic... It was overwhelming. Like many beginners, I started with languages like Python or C++, and I quickly learned that coding is all about logic. Fortunately, I had always enjoyed math since junior high school, so that helped a bit. <br><br>
                By the second and third semesters, we were introduced to web development—starting from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then gradually moving to PHP and databases. It wasn’t until I began my internship (PKL) that things truly clicked for me.<br><br>
                At that time, I was suddenly expected to learn PHP with Laravel and Git—with only two weeks to get up to speed. It was intense, but it was during this period that I discovered my genuine interest in creating programs and applications. My internship was actually at Madtive Studio, the same company I work for now.<br><br>
                I'm incredibly grateful to my mentor during that time, who constantly pushed me to keep learning. With nothing but YouTube tutorials from Web Programming UNPAS as my guide, I managed to grasp the fundamentals and complete my internship. My final project was a fully functional POS application, complete with data management, transactions, and reporting.<br><br>
                After finishing my internship and returning to school in my final year, I was given the opportunity to join a national competition in web and mobile app development hosted by PT Traspac Makmur Sejahtera. I was tasked with developing an innovative, fully implemented app within just three months—on top of attending classes. My teacher suggested I build a POS (Point-of-sales) app with an integrated accounting system for a library. It was exhausting, but also incredibly rewarding.<br><br>
                The competition consisted of just two rounds—and to my surprise, I won 3rd place. That moment became a major milestone for me; it was the first time I felt truly recognized in the world of programming.<br><br>
                Since then, I’ve continued to learn, build apps, and even work on this portfolio website.
                I could go on and on about my journey, but I think this is enough for now, haha.
                I just want to say that I started as a clueless kid who didn’t even know what programming was. And somehow, I ended up falling in love with it—and making it my career.

                Thank you for reading.
